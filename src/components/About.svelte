    <p class="mt-4">
        This is an SPA made with
        <a href="https://miragejs.com">Mirage</a>
        and
        <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte.</a>
        It has two routes to help demonstrate how Mirage's in-memory database enables realistic data
        fetching and persisting during a single application session.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">Mirage's state is reset whenever the application is reloaded.</p>
